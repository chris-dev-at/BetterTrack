/**
 * Typed domain events (PROJECTPLAN.md §9, §4.5).
 *
 * Services and jobs publish these on a Redis pub/sub bus; consumers — the
 * realtime gateway (→ socket rooms) and the notification dispatcher — subscribe.
 * Producers and consumers depend only on this typed surface, never on the raw
 * Redis channel layout, so a new consumer (mobile push, webhooks) is a new
 * subscriber rather than a producer rewrite.
 *
 * The union is exactly the five events enumerated in §9. Each payload carries
 * the identifiers the gateway needs to route the event to the right room
 * (§4.5: `user:{id}`, `asset:{id}`, `conglomerate:{id}`), plus an `occurredAt`
 * ISO timestamp stamped by the producer for ordering/debugging.
